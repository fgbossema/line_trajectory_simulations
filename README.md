# line_trajectory_simulations

This repository contains the code used for simulating 3D wood phantoms, as used for the article *Line trajectory X-ray tomography: a novel method for dendrochronology of large historical wooden objects* by Francien G. Bossema, Marta Domínguez-Delmás, Willem Jan Palenstijn, Sophia Bethany Coban, Erma Hermens and K. Joost Batenburg, submitted to Nature Scientific Reports. 

The repository consists of the following files: 
* **simulation_script.py** The main script, creating simulated data using the line trajectory scanning method and performing reconstruction. 
* **plank_phantom** Contains functions to create a 3D phantom containing concentric circles (tree rings) about a predefined axis (the pith).
* **line_geometry** Contains functions to create the line trajectory scanning geometry to create simulated X-ray projections.
